# Get-Me-Home
BECAUSE WHO NEEDS INTERNET TO GET HOME? 

Team: SHAURYA DHANKAR, DANIEL HOSSEINIAN, AN NGUYEN

Abstract

This app sends a text message to a server with the userâ€™s GPS location and preferred destination.
The server sends data via SMS back to the user with the directions.
The main goal of this project was to obtain directions via GPS and SMS technology in areas that lack network connectivity.



Future

Types of preferred destinations e.g. Gas station, restaurant, etc.
Auto-check for missed turns
Implement a peer-to-peer direction sharing network. Make everyone part of the server!
